When you type a https://www.google.com  into your browser, the first step is to resolve the domain name to an IP address. This process is known as a DNS (Domain Name System) request. Your browser sends a request to a DNS server, which then looks up the IP address associated with the domain name.Once the DNS server returns the IP address, your browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the web server using the IP address. TCP ensures that data is transmitted reliably over the internet by establishing a connection, dividing data into packets, and reassembling them at the destination.Before your request reaches the web server, it may pass through a firewall. Firewalls are a crucial part of network security, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic to protect against unauthorized access and malicious attacks.If the website uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), your browser and the web server will establish a secure connection using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security). This encryption ensures that data exchanged between your browser and the server is encrypted and secure from eavesdropping.In the case of popular websites like Google, incoming traffic is often distributed across multiple servers using a load balancer. Load balancers help distribute the load evenly, improving response times and reliability.Once your request reaches the web server, the server processes the request and retrieves the requested webpage or content. Common web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.For dynamic websites or web applications, the web server may communicate with an application server. The application server executes the code, retrieves data from databases, and generates the dynamic content to be sent back to the web server.If the requested content is stored in a database, the application server will query the database to retrieve the necessary data. Databases are essential for storing and managing large amounts of data for web applications.
